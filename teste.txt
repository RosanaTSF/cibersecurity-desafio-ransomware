Hakuna Matata (English Version) (2019)
O Rei Le√£o (The Lion King)

[Timon And Pumbaa]
Hakuna matata: What a wonderful phrase!
Hakuna matata! It ain't no passing craze!
It means no worries for the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata

[Simba]
Hakuna matata?

[Timon]
Yeah, it's our motto

[Simba]
What's a motto?

[Timon]
Nothin', what's the motto with you?

[Timon And Pumbaa]
Ace! Boom!

[Pumbaa]
Those two words will solve all your problems

[Timon]
Yeah, take Pumbaa, here
Why, when he was a young warthog

[Pumbaa]
When I was a young warthog

[Timon]
How you feelin'? 

[Pumbaa]
It's an emotional story

[Timon]
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the Savannah after every meal

[Pumbaa]
I'm a sensitive soul, although I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind

[Timon]
I was always here for you, and I resent that

[Pumbaa]
And, oh, the shame!

[Timon]
Yes, he was ashamed

[Pumbaa]
I thought of changing my name!

[Timon]
I mean, to what? Brad?

[Pumbaa]
And I got downhearted
Every time that I farted
Are you gonna stop me?

[Timon]
No, I'm not, you disgust me!

[Timon And Pumbaa]
Hakuna matata: What a wonderful phrase!
Hakuna matata! It ain't no passing craze!

[Simba, Timon And Pumbaa]
It means no worries for the rest of your days (yeah, sing it, kid)
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata

Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!

[Simba]
It means no worries for the rest of your days

[Simba, Timon And Pumbaa]
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata! (Hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
Hakuna matata, yeah (Hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
Hakuna matata, oh, ah (Hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
(Hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
It means no worries for the rest of your days
(Hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
(Hakuna matata, hakuna)
It's our problem-free philosophy

[Simba]
Hakuna matata
One more time

[Timon]
Oh, no, I think we did it (I think we got this one)

[Simba]
But we're just getting in the groove

[Timon]
No, let's leave 'em wanting more

[Pumbaa]
Yeah, you've grown 400 pounds since we started

[Timon]
Meanwhile, I look exactly the same

[Simba]
It means no worries, oh, yeah

[Pumbaa]
Will you tell him to stop?

[Timon]
Well, you insisted we sing this song

[Pumbaa]
I insisted? You started singing it!

[Timon]
It's our signature song, we shouldn't be sharing it!

[Pumbaa]
But it's our signature song, so we have to!

[Timon]
Look, just tell him to stop

[Simba]
It means no worries, ah, oh

[Timon]
Oh, now he's riffing, Pumbaa, this is a nightmare

[Pumbaa]
It actually is kinda getting better
